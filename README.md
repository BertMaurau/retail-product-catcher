"Drag the bag to catch the falling products."

## About
Attempt to create an Android/Html/IOS/.. 'catch the falling items' game using LibGDX.

This project is just for personal purposes. To improve my own personal experience and knwoledge. 
I have no intentions to develop a full game or release it on the Store.

I currently have a working Main Menu screen and the game. 


## Future implementations:
- Add bacgrkound music and sound effects
- Add a Background Image
- Add a Score-Counter
- Implement Variant Product images (t-shirts, shoes, pants, ..)
- Add an option for selecting your own bag (out of multiple bags)
- Add a 'Share' option
- Add some animations
